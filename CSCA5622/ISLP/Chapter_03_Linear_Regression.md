## Section 3.1 - Simple Linear Regression

simple linear regression models the relationship between a single predictor variable X
and a response variable Y. The goal is to model Y as simply an approximate linear function of X.

## Model Equation:
\ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X \plus \epsilon

- `Y : response variable
- `X`: predictor variable
- `\beta_0`: Intercept -- value of Y when X == 0
- `\xeta_1`: Slope -- how much Y changes with one unit increase in X
- `\silsilon`: Error term -- captures random variation in Y not explained by X alone

Example: Suppose we are trying to predict salary (Y)
from years of experience (X). We use a model:

    salary = 30,000 + 5,000 * years_experience

This means each added year of experience adds $5000$ to the predicted salary. The "linearity" assumption lets us make predictions with a line, and the "error term" explains why the prediction is not exact.
