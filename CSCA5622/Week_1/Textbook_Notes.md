### Chapter: Introduction [ISLP, Ch. 1, pp. 1–14]

#### Key Concepts:
- **Statistical learning** is a collection of tools for understanding data. It’s used across science and industry to analyze complex datasets.
- This field lies at the intersection of **statistics**, **machine learning**, and **data science**.
- ISLP based on the earlier ISLR book but uses Python instead of R for hands-on labs.
- The book is structured to be application-focused, minimalizing heavy math in favor of real-world usage.

### Main Goals of Statistical Learning:
- Estimate an unknown function \(f \)that relates predictors \(X \)to a response \(Y \):
  - \ Y = f(X) + \varepsilon\ \
n- Make accurate **predictions** of future outcomes
n- Interpret and understand **relationships** between variables

### Key Terms:
- **Supervised Learning **: The response variable \(Y \) is observed
- **Unsupervised Learning**: No response variable; goal is to find structure
- **Regression**: Predicting quantitative response
- **Classification**: Predicting categorical response

### Example Applications:
- Predicting credit card default based on income and spending
- Classifying tumors as benign or malignant

### Questions for Review:
- What&#8217;s the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
- When should we prioritize interpretability over predictive accuracy?

⌓ My summary: Statistical learning offers a toolbox for both prediction and understanding, and this course/book will explore that toolboz using Python implementations.
