# APPA 5001-200: Probability Foundations for Data Science and AI

This directory contains my materials for APPA 5001-200, an introduction to probability with an emphasis on how core probabilistic concepts connect to statistics and data science workflows.

## Course Overview
- Understand what probabilities represent and how to calculate them in practice.
- Distinguish independent and dependent outcomes and reason about conditional events.
- Study discrete and continuous random variables in the context of data collection.
- Explore Gaussian (normal) random variables and the Central Limit Theorem to see why they are foundational for statistics and data science.

## Directory Structure
- `textbook-notes/`: Detailed notes and worked examples derived from the course textbook and supplemental readings.
- `lecture-notes/`: Summaries, key takeaways, and clarifying questions captured from class meetings.
- `assignments/`: Problem sets, projects, and any supporting materials for graded work.

Each subdirectory can include additional nested folders for organization (e.g., week numbers or topics) as needed.
